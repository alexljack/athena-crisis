# Getting Started

Athena Crisis is a modern retro turn-based strategy game developed by [Nakazawa Tech](https://nkzw.tech). The source code of Athena Crisis is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and can be used to improve Athena Crisis, build additional tools, study game development with JavaScript or create entirely new turn-based strategy games.

This documentation website is aimed at explaining the core architecture and provides playgrounds to try out various parts of the codebase. To get started, you can clone the codebase using `git`:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis.git
```

Athena Crisis requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and the latest major version of [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation). After installing the latest versions, you can get started quickly with these commands:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev:setup
pnpm dev
```

The above commands set up the repository. After they complete, you can visit [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003/) to run the local version of this documentation website.
